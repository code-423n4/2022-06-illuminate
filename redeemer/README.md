# Redeemer

This README document explains each of the contracts in this directory and their relavance to the final product.

## Interfaces.sol

External Contracts: NA
Libraries: NA

This is a conventional interfaces file. We use it to call methods in external contracts, in particular other procotol's redemption methods.

## MarketPlace.sol

External Contracts: NA
Libraries: NA

This file can be ignored. It used only to provide the `Principals` enum to the Redeemer contract.

### Description

This is a critical contract. It will be used by Illuminate admins and users to route owed debt back to users after their loans have matured. 

Users redeem their debt in a two step process. Once a particular market's loans have matured, users or the protocol may call the `redeem` method for that protocol using its `Principals` enum int value (e.g. Swivel = 1, Yield = 2, ...). Those `redeem` calls will transfer the principal tokens from the `Lender.sol` contract to the redeemer contract's address. From there, the redeemer will call in the principal's `redeem` call, which will transfer owed underlying tokens to the redeemer contract. From there, a user can call `redeem` on Illuminate's `redeem` method, and that will transfer the underlying tokens back to their wallet based on their balance of zcTokens for the given market.

#### Specific Concerns

It is very important that a user is not able to withdraw more capital than they have owed to them. In general, when a principal's `redeem` method is called, we transfer all outstanding principal tokens for that market to the redeemer. From there, it is up to the user to `redeem` their owed debt by calling Illuminate's `redeem`.

We also want to be very careful to avoid reentrancy attacks as these contracts call into many external contracts.
