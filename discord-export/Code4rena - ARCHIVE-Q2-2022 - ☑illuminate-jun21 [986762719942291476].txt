The litepaper is ~50% complete while the smart contract documentation itself is completely buttoned up! If you see any mistakes / anything interesting or just have questions whatsoever feel free to reach out to me or @sourabh  personally!

Hi


[06/22/2022 1:22 PM] ak19966
I have doubt in the important section .. it's is mentioned like this


[06/22/2022 1:22 PM] ak19966
IMPORTANT NOTE:
When it comes to input sanitization, we err on the side of having external interfaces validate their input, rather than socializing costs to do checks such as:

Checking for address(0)
Checking for input amounts of 0
Checking to ensure the protocol enum matches the parameters provided
Any similar input sanitization


[06/22/2022 1:22 PM] ak19966
Can you pls add more infor on this..


[06/22/2022 1:23 PM] ak19966
To me.. i understand like the validation should be done in the dapp builder


[06/22/2022 1:23 PM] ak19966
So.. the contract will not be responsible for any of the invalid input


[06/22/2022 1:23 PM] ak19966
Is that it convey??


[06/22/2022 1:23 PM] ak19966
Pls clarify


[06/22/2022 1:54 PM] ak19966
And one  more


[06/22/2022 1:56 PM] ak19966
So.. i understand like liquidity should be there to unstake the stakend tokens..  will it have any use...user going to get one and add the same thing again inside the staking.. pls explain


[06/22/2022 8:38 PM] kulk0
Are there any tests for the contracts?


[06/23/2022 3:55 AM] Julian | Illuminate#0001
Yeah thats correct! We generally want to place the validation of this sort of thing on the front-end rather than the smart contracts

im not 100% on your question here though, can you clarify for me a bit?

Which problem was solved with implementing Curve?

OK 

[06/23/2022 3:58 AM] Julian | Illuminate#0001
We use a custom testing suite that is super similar to solmate, where the contracts directly interface with GETH


[06/23/2022 3:58 AM] Julian | Illuminate#0001
Called "GOST", you can find the unit tests for all the contracts in the /test folder, with the most recent changes in this branch, and example here: https://github.com/Swivel-Finance/gost/blob/illuminate/test/marketplace/marketplace.go

[06/23/2022 4:08 AM] p12473
Is it fair to say that any issues pertaining to the lack of input validation will be considered invalid?


[06/23/2022 4:08 AM] p12473
what about privileged functions being abused? I assume that's out of scope as well.


[06/23/2022 4:18 AM] Julian | Illuminate#0001
lol yeah I'd personally say theyd be invalid. 

Stuff that isnt really a vulnerability and where errors can be prevented by front ends, really I think the best example is if the `a` amount passed is 0

what framework does this project use, seems to just be contracts and missing most of everything one needs to actually work w/ the project in testing tools, etc


[06/23/2022 10:31 AM] fufanuu
so you're specifically leaving these Validation Errors in the contracts?

but generally speaking it's a matter of opinion and design


[06/23/2022 12:09 PM] kenzoagada
Also when these kind of errors are reported it can generate a ton of reports which are not really useful which require to validate every thing in the system

there were a couple new commits after contest started so previous submissions may be pointing to incorrect line numbers - just a heads up for anyone reviewing reports

Hi @💼sponsors, anyone available to respond to the wardens?

{Reactions}
👍 

[06/23/2022 8:13 PM] m4rio.eth
also another good practice when you want to get your code audited: include the dependencies, like:
this is the contract X, Y, Z we are interacting with


[06/23/2022 8:13 PM] m4rio.eth
it saves time for the auditor. Your purpose is to let to the auditor more time to look on the flows/code and not to search for the dependencies

[06/23/2022 8:20 PM] sourabh.
What are you referring to specifically here?


[06/23/2022 8:20 PM] m4rio.eth
i mean the naming of the parameters


[06/23/2022 8:21 PM] sourabh.
I don't think he's referring to all validation errors. For example, in cases where a malicious user could circumvent the front end and pass insecure parameters, we definitely want to address those problems


[06/23/2022 8:22 PM] sourabh.
I see, yes. That's just a naming convention we have for parameters. We feel that the natspec should indicate the purpose of the parameter, so a shorter name uses less space. I can sympathize with it being grating if one is not used to it!


[06/23/2022 8:24 PM] m4rio.eth
quite hard to follow them through the contract :pepeCryRunning:


[06/23/2022 8:26 PM] sourabh.
Apologies for that -- hopefully since parameters are limited to methods they don't cause too many headaches. The attributes should be identified by full words

^^ We've had a ton of our own internal discussions before about naming (personally i agree with yall but thats beside the point lol), and essentially are erring on the side of our most experienced long term dev where the claim is that the larger the codebase gets over time, the more optimization for code readability over variable readability becomes important

is this even a correct statement? Aren't the variables optimized away when being compiled anyway?


[06/25/2022 3:19 AM] Julian | Illuminate#0001
🤷 again i sympathize with yall lol, but you definitely do get used to it after some time

It does help reading *quicker* and scanning the codebase if youre familiar with the natspec

But its up to you to say whether *quicker* is ever better :LUL:


[06/25/2022 3:19 AM] kenzoagada
Maybe the dev meant that in a large codebase, too many variables with too long and intricate namings will impair general function readability... That's how I understand it


[06/25/2022 3:20 AM] Julian | Illuminate#0001
^^ yeah pretty much this.

Nope we don't normally allow changing the commit during the contest. This one was done accidentally early on and once it was changed it can't easily be changed back because some people will be looking at the new commit.
My recommendation is to just work off the commit you started on, post the githublinks to that commit etc

[06/25/2022 7:34 AM] ak19966
Okey..


[06/25/2022 7:35 AM] ak19966
the fact is.. when something is committed after the contest started. the participants may start working on different versions of code which will dilute the spirit of competition


[06/25/2022 9:01 AM] kirk_baird
Yea it's not great hey, it's happened a few times. One solution that is being considered is not letting anyone have access to the findings repo or main repo until after a contest ends.


[06/25/2022 9:19 AM] ak19966
thats what I am also thinking... its better solution


[06/25/2022 12:45 PM] Julian | Illuminate#0001
So the only changes that got sent through were 
1. An interfaces issue where the wrong interfaces got added to the repo (causing things literally not to compile), so a warden requested an update there and we updated it from "IErc20"->"IERC20"
2. Similarly for compilation we use the new --via-ir to help with stack depth and it was messing with some wardens compilation so we added scoping to some methods for them.

So none of this should impact the contest whatsoever I'd think?

[06/25/2022 12:46 PM] Julian | Illuminate#0001

**You: A lender looking to get the best rate possible (off-chain)**

1. Call our API to request the "best rate". We query all the AMMs, etc., and return the correct params, etc., for you to call `lend`.
2. You call lend, effectively purchasing PTs from an external protocol, and wrapping them into iPTs, leaving the external PTs in lender.sol
3. Time passes
3a. Maturity for the external PT hits, and *someone* (if noone external, the admins can) calls `redeem` for the external PT. This transfers PTs from lender.sol to redeemer.sol, redeems them into underlying.
4. You the lender come and redeem your iPT, it gets burnt and you get returned a 1-1 amount of underlying (that is currently in redeemer.sol)

{Reactions}

[06/25/2022 3:23 PM] Julian | Illuminate#0001
**You: An arbitrageur / MEV**

1. Constantly monitor the iPT pool as well as the external PT pools
2. Wait for an external PT for be < the iPT
3. Purchase external PT with underlying
4. Wrap external PT -> iPT 
5. sell iPT back to underlying pocketing the difference

[06/25/2022 3:25 PM] Julian | Illuminate#0001
**You: A lender trying to get the best rate (on-chain)**

1. integrate with iPT pool
2. `sellBase` through marketplace
TransfersFrom user -> iPT pool and purchases iPT
3-4. Same as off-chain

^^ This user can be confident they get the best rate due to the constant arbitrage by the case before it

@Julian | Illuminate could you better explain the contract and function called for 3a) and 4)?

in point 3a) the user (lender) call `Redeemer.redeem` (one of the overloaded method) right?
for method 4) Could you explain better this part?


[06/26/2022 2:04 PM] sourabh.
I think 3a and 4 are related so I'll try to provide a bit of clarity here:
Both the `lend` method in Lender.sol and the `redeem` method are overloaded in Redeemer.sol. Users will call Illuminate's `redeem` method to redeem their debt. 
In other words, the non-Illuminate `redeem` calls transfer the principal tokens from the lender contract to the redeemer contract and then retrieve the underlying asset from their respective protocol. From there, Illuminate's `redeem` burns the user's iPTs, and in turn sends the user the underlying asset. The redemption process is a two step process with the overloaded `redeem` method getting called twice.

{Reactions}
thankyou 👍

there's no way this is more efficient for a dev than using full words in any situation.


[06/26/2022 8:12 PM] fufanuu
especially because you want to think about new devs coming in to work on your codebase that have no knowledge.


[06/26/2022 8:12 PM] fufanuu
just my .02 but one of our rules is a hard and fast no abbreviations.

I've been coding for more than 12 years now


[06/26/2022 8:13 PM] fufanuu
having to lookup natspec every time i see a letter is painful


[06/26/2022 8:13 PM] m4rio.eth
never ever i heard someone saying that variables m, a, c, d


[06/26/2022 8:14 PM] m4rio.eth
makes the code more readable 😆


[06/26/2022 8:14 PM] fufanuu
ditto, going on 20 years here

it's always been a huge NOPE in any team i've run.


[06/26/2022 8:14 PM] m4rio.eth
that is why everyone is happy with the compilers


[06/26/2022 8:14 PM] m4rio.eth
like write big ass variables


[06/26/2022 8:14 PM] m4rio.eth
and the compiler is making sure it does not matter


[06/26/2022 8:14 PM] m4rio.eth
:d


[06/26/2022 8:14 PM] fufanuu
yea i would rather have `somethingThatTellsMeWhatItIs` than `s`


[06/26/2022 8:15 PM] m4rio.eth
everyone is blaming java but java code is very readable


[06/26/2022 8:15 PM] m4rio.eth
every method you kinda know what it does without even looking too much


[06/26/2022 8:15 PM] fufanuu
i'll be honest, i stopped working on this cause i got tired of referencing natspec all the time

Honestly I found the short variables names quite nice in the end. I see the point that it makes it easier to see at a glance what the actual function code does.


[06/27/2022 4:57 AM] anonnp
Hey that variable naming was a lot better than Maker's one 🙂 wen MakerDAO contest? :9029_hehe_pepe:

Hey @Julian | Illuminate , can you check your DM please. It's not related with the contest btw.

Well I actually DO appreciate the input

[06/27/2022 12:41 PM] Julian | Illuminate#0001
Even if folks are memeing it into existenxe lol, it's something I've personally argued a bit about in the past so we might end up with a move towards more standard variables with all the outside input


[06/27/2022 12:41 PM] Julian | Illuminate#0001
(Wed done a few audits in the past and noone bitched before so I thought I was crazy lol)

[06/27/2022 12:43 PM] Julian | Illuminate#0001
And having folks care enough to complain in my mind is good. It's important to get the most out of audits and making auditors lives fun/easy is most of that job really

Allright. I take back what I said.


[06/27/2022 12:48 PM] Julian | Illuminate#0001
Lolol I think yall might be clowning a bit *too* hard but I don't take it personally


[06/27/2022 12:54 PM] cryptphi
hopefully you didn't mind i sent the unconventional naming issue as a non-critical finding, it's an audit so submitting it as a low or informational finding is a proper way to go about it. It's left to the sponsor to accept it. At least that's how it's done in my previous consulting experience

what happend whit this contest? there was the PR with the awards and now the PR has been closed. Could you give us an update?


[08/04/2022 8:56 AM] thepicodes
Probably some last minute change in judging. It should be out soon as it already went through post judging Q&A


[08/04/2022 9:07 AM] anonnp
It looked like there were some merge conflicts there. Idk if there was any other problem also

I don’t received an award for Illuminate


[08/17/2022 12:11 PM] okkothejawa
Asking just to be sure, if you are using Metamask or a similar wallet, did you import the address of USDC on Polygon to your wallet?


[08/17/2022 12:14 PM] bnke0x0
Is ETH wallet address


[08/17/2022 12:14 PM] bnke0x0
Payeer


[08/17/2022 12:14 PM] bnke0x0
I used Payeer wallet


[08/17/2022 12:15 PM] okkothejawa
The payments are done through Polygon, not ETH mainnet


[08/17/2022 12:15 PM] bnke0x0
Oh no 🙊


[08/17/2022 12:16 PM] okkothejawa
In the case of Metamask, addresses support all EVM based chains


[08/17/2022 12:16 PM] okkothejawa
not sure about Payeer but its worth checking, maybe it supports Polygon too!


[08/17/2022 12:17 PM] codingnamekiki
l have a similar question, so l can receive future awards on metamask polygon mainnet right?


[08/17/2022 12:18 PM] bnke0x0
I don’t sure about it


[08/17/2022 12:19 PM] bnke0x0
I open help ticket on code4rena website


[08/17/2022 12:21 PM] okkothejawa
If you already have an address on Metamask, yes you can. Metamask supports other EVM chains such as BSC or Polygon

To be extra comfy, add Polygon network to your wallet (take care with adding the correct one) and the USDC contract to it
